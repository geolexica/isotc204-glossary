  definition:
  - content: area above the {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.1.3,roadway}} that is primarily
      designed for the movement of {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.7.1.1,vehicle,vehicles}}
  examples: []
  notes:
  - content: In practice, the driving space design considers a variety of issues,
      which can result in suboptimal {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.5.1,road}} segments
      that violate normal design guidelines. Such {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.4.1.1,location,locations}}
      are typically posted with warning signs, but they are still designed for the
      movement of vehicles.
  - content: While the driving space is designed with certain vehicle characteristics
      in mind, local regulations typically allow a wider set of vehicles to use the
      driving space.
