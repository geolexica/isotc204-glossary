  definition:
  - content: set of ideas, abstractions or things in the real world that are identified
      with explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties and behaviour follow
      the same rules
  examples: []
  notes:
  - content: Some ISO/TC 204 documents use the term "object class" for consistency
      with <<ISO_11179_1>>, but within ITS, the term "class" is more generally understood.
  - content: This is semantically equivalent to a "class" as used within UML (<<ISO19505_2_2012,ISO19505-2:2012>>).
