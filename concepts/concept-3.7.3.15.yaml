      {{vehicle}} integrated with an {{ADS}}
  notes:
  - content: The terms "automated vehicle" and "AV" are often used in a colloquial
      form. However, these terms can be used to mean either an "ADS-equipped vehicle"
      or a "vehicle with an engaged ADS". The term "ADS-equipped vehicle" is preferred
      since it is more precise and descriptive in its meaning.
  - content: The term "autonomous vehicle" is also often used in a colloquial form
      and is even less well defined. The term is particularly problematic because
      the word "autonomous" has been used for a long time in the robotics and artificial
      intelligence research communities to signify {{system,systems}} that have the
      ability and authority to make decisions independently and self-sufficiently.
      Due to its imprecise and overly broad meaning, use of the term "autonomous vehicle"
      is discouraged.
  - content: This term can be, and when possible should be, refined by identifying
      the level of automation. For example, the terms "level 5 ADS-equipped vehicle"
      and "level 5 automated vehicle" should be interpreted as "ADS-equipped vehicle
      where the ADS is a _level 5 ADS_." ({{level 5 ADS,3.7.3.13,options="noref,noital,linkmention"}}).
  - content: This term only describes the capabilities of the vehicle, not its operational
      state. In other words, the term applies as long as the ADS is {{connected}}
      to the vehicle, whether the {{dynamic driving task,DDT}} is actively engaged
      or not.
