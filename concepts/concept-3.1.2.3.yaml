      surface or near-surface of the Earth"
  notes:
  - content: A surface transport system can include tunnels, bridges and similar {{<<urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.1.3.10>>,element,elements}}.
  - content: There is not complete agreement on the precise limitations of a "surface
      transport system" within the ITS community. Currently, the term is almost exclusively
      applied to ground-based travel of goods and people over significant distances.
      The term is viewed as including ferry systems, which often form an integral
      part of a local surface transport system; it is less clear if it includes long-distance
      sea-fairing ships. The term "surface transport systems" is also generally limited
      to transport systems that cover a considerable distance (e.g. factory conveyance
      technologies are not often referred to as "surface transport systems"). It has
      been suggested that air travel, which is arguably a transport system designed
      to move physical entities between points on the surface of the earth, ought
      to be included in the scope of the term, but this perspective is not universally
      accepted. It is expected that the exact limitations of the term will be further
      refined as ITS matures.
  - content: Due to the defined scope of ITS, the term "transport system" is intended
      to be interpreted as being synonymous with the term "surface transport system"
      unless explicitly specified otherwise.
