  terms:
  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: data concept
  definition:
  - content: "{{data element}}, {{class}}, {{value domain}}, {{data frame}}, {{message}}
      or {{interface dialogue}} defined, at a minimum, with an unambiguous identifier
      and a definition"
  notes:
  - content: In order to exchange a value corresponding to a data concept, more information
      than an identifier, a name and a definition can be needed. For a property, a
      data type is needed. Depending on the kind of property, other data elements
      such as unit of measure, and language, can be needed as well. The additional
      information can be given in the {{data dictionary}}, in a data specification
      that references the data concept or associated with the data themselves.
