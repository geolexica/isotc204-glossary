    normative_status: preferred
    designation: shared transport service
  definition:
  - content: "{{transport service}} that relies upon the same {{resource,resources}}
      to fulfil the _transport_ {{transport need,needs}} of multiple unrelated {{transport
      user,transport users}} and where the {{transport provider}} has the primary
      responsibility for the operation of the transport mode"
  notes:
  - content: A shared transport service might not be dependent upon a vehicle and/or
      could be multi-modal. For example, a letter courier service could rely on walking
      and {{public transport}}.
  - content: Responsibilities of the transport service can be further delegated to
      others. For example, a courier service relying on public transport would delegate
      the operation of the transport mode to the public transport operator.
