  notes:
  - content: In contrast to this generic term for any level 1-5 system, the specific
      term for a level 3-5 system is "Automated Driving System (ADS)." Given the similarity
      between the generic term, "driving automation system," and the level 3-5-specific
      term, "Automated Driving System," the latter term is intentionally capitalized
      when spelled out and reduced to its acronym, "ADS", as much as possible, while
      "driving automation system" should not be.
  - content: A driving automation system includes any system capable of level 1-5
      driving automation.
