  terms:
  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: travelled way
  definition:
  - content: part of the {{roadway}} that is currently intended for transport purposes
  notes:
  - content: The travelled way does not include {{hard shoulder,hard shoulders}},
      {{hardstanding}}, or other areas that are not currently intended for normal
      operational use. In other words, while these other areas are "designed" for
      transport purposes, they are not "intended" for normal transport purposes (at
      present); rather these extra areas exist for safety and other exceptional use
      conditions.
  - content: While the limits of the roadway are defined by the design of the physical
      infrastructure and are generally static; the limits of the travelled way can
      be dynamic, such as in the case of a {{hard shoulder for emergency use}} being
      converted into {{hard shoulder running}} operation.
