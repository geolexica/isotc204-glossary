  terms:
  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: travelled way
  definition:
  - content: part of the {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.1.3,roadway}} that is currently
      intended for transport purposes
  notes:
  - content: The travelled way does not include {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.1.19,hard
      shoulder,hard shoulders}}, {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.1.17,hardstanding}},
      or other areas that are not currently intended for normal operational use. In
      other words, while these other areas are "designed" for transport purposes,
      they are not "intended" for normal transport purposes (at present); rather these
      extra areas exist for safety and other exceptional use conditions.
  - content: While the limits of the roadway are defined by the design of the physical
      infrastructure and are generally static; the limits of the travelled way can
      be dynamic, such as in the case of a {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.4.1,hard shoulder
      for emergency use}} being converted into {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.4.2,hard
      shoulder running}} operation.
