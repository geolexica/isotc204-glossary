      <ITS-S> protocol layer in the {{ITS-S reference architecture,ITS station reference architecture}} containing the OSI session, presentation and application layer protocols
  notes:
  - content: Within the US, the NTCIP standards call the facilities layer the "application
      layer". However, as this term is easily confused with both the OSI application
      layer and the {{application entity}}, the term should be avoided and qualified
      when used (e.g. OSI application layer).
