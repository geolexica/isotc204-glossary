  definition:
  - content: integration of each {{physical object}} necessary to implement one or
      more {{ITS application,ITS applications}}
  notes:
  - content: An ITS application typically requires multiple components (e.g. an ITS-S
      acting as a user and another ITS-S acting as a provider). An ITS implementation
      includes a sample of each component necessary for the service but often does
      not represent a complete deployment.
  - content: An ITS implementation is typically used for a laboratory or other experimental
      {{environment}} prior to a full-scale deployment.
