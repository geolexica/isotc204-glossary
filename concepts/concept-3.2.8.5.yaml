  - content: integration of each {{<<urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.1.8.1>>,physical object}}
      necessary to implement one or more {{<<urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.2.8.1>>,ITS application,ITS
      applications}}
  notes:
  - content: An ITS application typically requires multiple components (e.g. an ITS-S
      acting as a user and another ITS-S acting as a provider). An ITS implementation
      includes a sample of each component necessary for the service but often does
      not represent a complete deployment.
  - content: An ITS implementation is typically used for a laboratory or other experimental
      {{<<urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.1.3.11>>,environment}} prior to a full-scale deployment.
