  - content: part of the {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.1.9.4,ITS-S reference architecture,ITS
      station reference architecture}} that is responsible for providing ITS-related
      functionality
  notes:
  - content: Within the US, the National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol
      (NTCIP) standards identify an "information layer" on top of the traditional
      OSI stack. However, the purpose of this layer includes both information configuration
      and functionality. The ITS-S reference architecture separates these two roles
      between the {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.1.5.6,management entity}} and the application
      entity.
