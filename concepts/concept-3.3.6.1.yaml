  - content: space where two or more {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.5.1,road,roads}}
      meet or cross
  notes:
  - content: Complex intersections can be viewed as multiple intersections by providing
      separate designations for distinct {{urn:iso:std:iso:14812:3.3.5.6,road link,road
      links}}. For example, one model could depict a complex intersection as being
      associated with multiple junctions; another model could depict the same physical
      infrastructure as being multiple intersections that are interconnected by different
      roads, each with its own designator (e.g. "ramp from northbound Road A to eastbound
      Road B").
