  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: intersection
  definition:
  - content: space where two or more {{road,roads}} meet or cross
  notes:
  - content: Intersections can be associated with zero {{junction,junctions}}, such
      as a motorway crossing a road without any connecting ramps, or can be associated
      with one or more junctions, such as a diamond {{interchange}}.
  - content: Complex intersections can be viewed as multiple intersections by providing
      separate designations for distinct {{road link,road links}}. For example, one
      model could depict a complex intersection as being associated with multiple
      junctions; another model could depict the same physical infrastructure as being
      multiple intersections that are interconnected by different roads, each with
      its own designator (e.g. "ramp from northbound Road A to eastbound Road B").
